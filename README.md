Our website provides a resource for those seeking to learn about the impact of COVID-19 and its effects on human isolation and activity, and also a place for people to discuss and share their stories.

The satellite imagery used is sourced from VIIRS_SNPP_DayNightBand_ENCC, and accessed using the GIBS API and WMTS.

Previously hosted on AWS, and due to a db restore, the social media function is for presentation only.

## Installation 

In root directory, run npm install then npm start.
Access site at localhost:3000!
